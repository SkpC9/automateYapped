# automateYapped
## About
This is for the automation of merging regulation.bin files from Elden Ring mods. Yapped is used for extracting regulation.bin and importing csv files. This program uses [pywinauto](https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto) for automation, and [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/) for csv processing.<br>
This program is developed with using [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) and [ModEngine2](https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2/releases) in mind.<br>
If mod authors provide csv files, this program can be configured to merge their mods using csv instead of regulation.bin to reduce the time cost

## Usage
1. Install [Yapped-Rune-Bear v2.14](https://github.com/vawser/Yapped-Rune-Bear/releases/tag/2.14)
2. Download exe file from release page
3. Open the exe. Initial open will auto create ini config file. Follow the example to set those values according to your file paths
4. Do as the program instructed. Press Enter to start, don't touch keyboard or mouse after start
5. Wait until it says all done, the press Enter to exit.
6. Get the merged regulation.bin file from merged_regulation_path(set in ini) and enjoy!
